### About Me

My adventure with programming began in 2018 . Then my first "Hello world" was created, as for the language it fell on JavaScript. And so over the years I develop this passion for programming with more and more different skills. I follow the principle of "The best-fitting programming language for the task" that's why you can find many of them on my repository. I am constantly learning and developing , and coding still surprises me ðŸ˜Ž
